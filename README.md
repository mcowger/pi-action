# PI Action

A GitHub Action that invokes the [PI coding agent](https://github.com/mariozechner/pi-coding-agent) on issues and pull requests via comment triggers.

## Features

- 🤖 Trigger PI agent with customizable phrases (default: `@pi`)
- 🔒 Security-first: Only allows repo owners, members, and collaborators
- 🤝 Bot allowlist for automation workflows
- 📝 Works on both issues and pull requests
- 🔀 Automatically includes PR diffs for code review tasks

## Usage

### Basic Setup

Create `.github/workflows/pi-assistant.yml`:

```yaml
name: PI Assistant

on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  pi-response:
    if: contains(github.event.comment.body, '@pi')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
      issues: write
      pull-requests: write

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      - name: Install PI
        run: npm install -g @mariozechner/pi-coding-agent

      - name: Run PI Action
        uses: cv/pi-action@v1
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          pi_auth_json: ${{ secrets.PI_AUTH_JSON }}
```

### Authentication

PI requires authentication with your LLM provider. Set up the `PI_AUTH_JSON` secret in your repository:

1. Run `pi` locally and complete OAuth authentication
2. Copy the contents of `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`
3. Add it as a repository secret named `PI_AUTH_JSON`

Alternatively, you can set provider-specific environment variables (e.g., `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).

### Inputs

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `github_token` | GitHub token for API access | Yes | - |
| `pi_auth_json` | Contents of `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` | No | - |
| `trigger_phrase` | Phrase to trigger PI | No | `@pi` |
| `allowed_bots` | Comma-separated list of allowed bot usernames | No | - |
| `timeout` | Execution timeout in seconds | No | `300` |
| `provider` | LLM provider (anthropic, openai, google, etc.) | No | `anthropic` |
| `model` | Model ID | No | `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` |

### Examples

#### Allow Dependabot to trigger PI

```yaml
- uses: cv/pi-action@v1
  with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    allowed_bots: 'dependabot[bot],renovate[bot]'
```

#### Use a different model

```yaml
- uses: cv/pi-action@v1
  with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    provider: 'openai'
    model: 'gpt-4o'
```

#### Custom trigger phrase

```yaml
- uses: cv/pi-action@v1
  with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    trigger_phrase: '@assistant'
```

## How It Works

1. When a comment containing the trigger phrase is posted on an issue or PR, the action is triggered
2. The action validates that the comment author has write access to the repository
3. An 👀 reaction is added to acknowledge the request
4. PI is invoked with the issue/PR context and the task from the comment
5. The response is posted as a new comment with a 🚀 reaction

## Security

The action only responds to users with write access:
- Repository owners
- Organization members
- Collaborators

Bots are blocked by default unless explicitly added to the `allowed_bots` list.

Input is sanitized to remove:
- HTML comments (potential injection vectors)
- Invisible Unicode characters
